Boolean Autocrats - Gebeya App
It is a long-established fact that our world is evolving in technology as new ideas and
applications emerge every day. But even if our world is changing in every aspects of technology our
country is still trying to assimilate those pieces for a better future. So, as a developer we wanted to
contribute a fruitful App for those working on the Economic sector and fulfill one of the SDG goals which
is to prevent poverty.
One may encounter a store equipped with high quality products that are highly demanded in
the community however, this store my not be able to reach the right customers without opening a
physical branch store in certain areas. Therefore, we decided to ease this problem by creating the
Gebeya App as a Solution.
Our Gebya app will help anyone create, edit products and reach customers in a very simple way.
Even if the app looks simple it is quite full of basic features for selling online, including many items based
on any product categories. The application is written on the native Kotlin language, using Php / Mysql as
a webservice for the admin site. So, for the demo presentation of our app we added these features to
show case the App in a clear and simple way.
